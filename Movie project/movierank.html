<h2><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3577244/">Lorai</a></h2>
<hr/>
<p> 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K26ijlD5pz0&ab_channel=GreenTouchEntertainment"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGRlYzllOTYtMzExYi00NzM2LWJmNmEtZTY0ZTMzYWZhN2RlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjA3OTI5MjA@._V1_.jpg" alt=""></a><br />
    Language: Bengali<br />
    "Lorai", in Bengali means fight.<br />
This movie is about a depressed football coach, who had to quit playing footbal due to an injury when he was at his peak.<br />
He makes a footbal team in a remote village, most of whom did not know about football.<br />
This movie beautifully shows how the coach teaches his team the meaning of footbal, and how his team teaches him the meaning of life.<br />
"Lorai" teaches us that our fight should not be with the society or with our enemy or with anyone else, the fight should be deep within ourslves, afight against all odds within us.
